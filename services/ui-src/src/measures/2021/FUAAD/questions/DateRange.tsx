          For all measures, states should report start and end dates to
          calculate the denominator. For some measures, the specifications
          require a “look-back period” before or after the measurement period to
          determine eligibility or utilization. The measurement period entered
          in the Start and End Date fields should not include the “look-back
          period.”
